# ðŸŽƒ Cross Site Scripting(XSS) Demo

## Watch the Video First!

Video Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIXzZVBy528 \
In this video I covered how to perform cross site scripting (XSS), which basically allows attackers to have full control over a vulnerable website ðŸ˜ˆ. Just like always, this video is for educational purposes. If you do any illegal stuff you will get arrested ðŸš“!

## Instalation

Install MySQL:

- https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/chi-wei-lien/xss-injection
```

Install packages

```
npm install
```

Create a .env file in the <b>outside</b> of "views" and it should look like this \
.env

```
DB_PASS=[your database password]
PORT=3000
MY_SECRET=[you can create any secret you want - this is for express session]
```

Login into your MySQL in a separate tab on your terminal (I prefer iterm)

```
mysql -u root -p;
```

Create a table called students (varchar(255) means length with 255 characters)

```
CREATE TABLE Users (
    password varchar(255),
	username varchar(255)
);
```

Insert some user data like this

```
INSERT INTO Users VALUES ("wilson", "1234@cool");
INSERT INTO Users VALUES ("hacker", "1234");
```

Create another table called Admin

```
CREATE TABLE Admin (
	username varchar(255),
    password varchar(255)
);
```

Insert some users data like this

```
INSERT INTO Admin VALUES ("wilson", "1234@cool");
```

Create another table called Pic

```
CREATE TABLE Pic (
	pic varchar(255),
    subtitle varchar(255),
    title varchar(255)
);
```

Run the vulnerable web!

```
cd vulnerable_web
npm start
```

Go to "http://localhost:3000/" in your browser

Run the cookie stealer!

```
cd cookie_stealer
node index.js
```
